We want to import into Place all the schools information from CSV file.

The CSV file has the following columns:

- name
- neighbourhood: Name of the neighbourhood of the campus
- city: City of the campus
- private: true if private school (boolean)
- international: true if international school (boolean)
- levels: List of level offered in the school  (separated by semi-colons)
- language: List of languages in the school (2 letter code - separated by semi-colons))
- curriculum: List if countries associated with the curriculum offered in the school (separated by semi-colons)
- diplomas: List of diplomas obtained at the school (separated by semi-colons)
- websiteUrl: URL of the website

The list of schools are available in the resource file place/refdata/schools.csv (in koki-server module).

# API

- We want to expose the endpoint GEO /places/import/schools that will trigger the import of all schools from the CSV
  file into Place.
- We want the ref-data importer to also import the schools from the CSV file into Place.

# Instruction for importing

- If the school is already existing (based on name + city), update in information
- If the school does not exist, create it
- The Place type should be SCHOOL
- The Place status should be PUBLISHED
- Do not generate any content for the school (no AI generation)
