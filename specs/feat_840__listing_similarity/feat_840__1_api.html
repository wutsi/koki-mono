Add a endpoint to return listings similar to another one.

# API Endpoint
Endpoint: /v1/listings/<id>/similar
    Headers:
    - Tenant ID
    Parameters:
    - status - (Optional) Statuses of the similar properties
    - same-agent - (Optional). If `true`, the listing return will have the same seller agent as the original listing. Default=false
    - same-neighborhood - (Optional). If `true`, the listing return will ben in the same neighborhood as the original listing. Default=false
    - same-city - (Optional). If `true`, the listing return will ben in the same city as the original listing. Default=false
    - limit - (Optional) Maximum number of similar listings to return. Default=10, Max=50
    Response
    - List of ListingSimilaritySummary sorted by score. Each item has the following field:
    - id: ID of the listing
    - score: 0..1

    # Similarity Rules
    Similar listings should respect the following rules:
    - The listing type must be the same as the reference listing
    - Prices within the same range: +/- 25%. For sold listings, use sales price
    - number of rooms withing the same range: +/- 1 (not for LAND, COMERCIAL or INDUSTRIAL listings)
    - listing types similarity rules:
    - LAND is ONLY similar to LAND
    - COMMERCIAL is ONLY similar to COMMERCIAL
    - INDUSTRIAL is ONLY similar to INDUSTRIAL
    - for the other types are similar to any type that is not LAND, COMMERCIAL or INDUSTRIAL

    # Similarity score
    Apply the following algorithm  for computing the similarity score:

    ```
    FUNCTION ComputeSimilarity(PA, PB, W_price, W_beds, W_type):

    // --- 1. Type Score (Stype) ---
    IF PA.type == PB.type:
    S_type = 1.0
    ELSE:
    S_type = 0.0
    // NOTE: If S_type is 0, the final score will be low.
    // You may choose to STOP and return 0 immediately here if
    // type mismatch is a hard filter.

    // --- 2. Bedroom Score (Sbeds) ---
    beds_diff = ABS(PA.bedrooms - PB.bedrooms)
    IF beds_diff == 0:
    S_beds = 1.0
    ELSE IF beds_diff == 1:
    S_beds = 0.5
    ELSE:
    S_beds = 0.0

    // --- 3. Price Score (Sprice) ---
    price_A = PA.price
    price_B = PB.price

    // Check if within the hard ±25% boundary
    lower_bound = price_A * 0.75
    upper_bound = price_A * 1.25

    IF price_B < lower_bound OR price_B > upper_bound:
    S_price = 0.0
    ELSE:
    // Calculate a score that peaks at 1.0 (perfect match) and decays to 0.0 at the boundaries.
    // A simple normalized distance metric is usually sufficient:
    price_diff_norm = ABS(price_A - price_B) / (price_A * 0.25)
    S_price = 1.0 - price_diff_norm
    // Note: The linear decay model ensures S_price is 1.0 at perfect match (0% diff)
    // and 0.0 at the boundary (25% diff).


    // --- 4. Final Weighted Score ---
    Total_Score = (W_price * S_price) + (W_beds * S_beds) + (W_type * S_type)

    RETURN Total_Score
    END FUNCTION
    ```

    Use the following weigths:
    - Property Type: 50%
    - Number of Bedrooms: 30%
    - Price ($W_{price}$): 20%


    # Additional Instructions

    - Implement the the similarity algorithm using strategy design pattern. We want to have the option of support in the future other similarity algorithms with minimal changes
    - Define the class `ListingSimilarityService` for finding similar listings.


    # ASK:
    - Generate the plan for these changes and store it into target/<feature>/report.md
        - Do not make any code change yet.
